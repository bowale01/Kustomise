Kustomize is a configuration management tool specifically designed for Kubernetes. It provides a way to customize application configurations without modifying the original YAML files, enabling more flexible and reusable Kubernetes deployments. Kustomize works by applying overlays to a set of base resources, allowing you to maintain clean, declarative configuration files while making environment-specific changes.

Here are the key concepts and features of Kustomize:

Key Concepts:
Base Resources:

These are the core YAML manifests that define your Kubernetes resources. They are environment-agnostic and can be reused across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Overlays:

Overlays are additional configurations applied on top of base resources to customize them for specific environments. Overlays can include patches, configuration changes, and additional resources.
Kustomization File:

Each directory that uses Kustomize must contain a kustomization.yaml file. This file specifies the resources, patches, and configurations that Kustomize should apply.
Features:
Resource Overlays:

Modify existing resources using patches. Patches can be in JSON, YAML, or strategic merge formats.
Resource Generators:

Generate ConfigMaps and Secrets from files or literals.
Variable Substitution:

Substitute variables in configuration files to dynamically adjust resource definitions based on the environment.
Transformers:

Apply transformations to resources, such as adding common labels or annotations, modifying image tags, or updating namespace information.
Composition:

Combine multiple kustomization.yaml files to build complex configurations from simpler, reusable parts.
